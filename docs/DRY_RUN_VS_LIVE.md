# Dry Run vs Live Trading

## Current Status: DRY RUN MODE ‚úÖ

Your Freqtrade is currently in **DRY RUN** mode, which is **SAFE** and **CORRECT** for testing!

---

## What is Dry Run Mode?

### Dry Run (dry_run: true) - CURRENT MODE
```json
{
  "dry_run": true
}
```

**What happens:**
- ‚úÖ Strategy generates BUY/SELL signals
- ‚úÖ Freqtrade simulates order placement internally
- ‚úÖ Trades are tracked in the database
- ‚úÖ PnL is calculated based on price changes
- ‚ùå **NO actual API calls to OpenAlgo's placeorder endpoint**
- ‚ùå **NO real money involved**
- ‚ùå **NO real orders on your broker**

**Why you see:**
- ‚úÖ Trades in FreqUI (simulated)
- ‚úÖ OpenAlgo API calls for data (history, orderstatus)
- ‚ùå NO OpenAlgo API calls for placeorder
- ‚ùå Amount showing as 0 (simulation issue)

---

## Live Trading Mode

### Live Mode (dry_run: false)
```json
{
  "dry_run": false
}
```

**What happens:**
- ‚úÖ Strategy generates BUY/SELL signals
- ‚úÖ **REAL API calls to OpenAlgo's placeorder endpoint**
- ‚úÖ **REAL orders placed with your broker**
- ‚úÖ **REAL money is used**
- ‚úÖ Proper quantities calculated
- ‚úÖ PnL updates with real fills

**You will see:**
- ‚úÖ OpenAlgo placeorder API requests
- ‚úÖ Orders appearing in OpenAlgo dashboard
- ‚úÖ Orders executed on your broker (Zerodha/Finvasia/etc)
- ‚úÖ Proper amounts and quantities
- ‚úÖ Real PnL based on actual fills

---

## Why Dry Run First?

### Safety Reasons:
1. ‚úÖ Test strategy logic without risk
2. ‚úÖ Verify symbol mapping works
3. ‚úÖ Check data fetching is correct
4. ‚úÖ Ensure FreqUI displays properly
5. ‚úÖ No financial risk

### What We've Verified:
- ‚úÖ Symbol mapping: RELIANCE/INR ‚Üí RELIANCE on NSE
- ‚úÖ Data fetching: 472 candles from OpenAlgo
- ‚úÖ Strategy signals: BUY/SELL being generated
- ‚úÖ FreqUI: Displaying trades
- ‚úÖ All methods implemented

## How to Enable Live Trading

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This uses REAL MONEY!

### Step 1: Backup Your Config
```bash
cp config.json config.json.backup
```

### Step 2: Edit config.json
```bash
nano config.json
```

Change:
```json
{
  "dry_run": false,  // Change from true to false
  "stake_amount": 5000,  // Start with small amount
  "max_open_trades": 2  // Limit concurrent trades
}
```

### Step 3: Verify OpenAlgo
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Step 4: Start Live Trading
```bash
./start.sh
```

### Step 5: Monitor Closely
```bash
# Watch logs
tail -f user_data/logs/freqtrade.log | grep -E "(placeorder|Order placed)"

# Watch FreqUI
Open: http://localhost:8080

# Check OpenAlgo
Open: http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## Current Behavior Explained

### Why No placeorder Requests?
**Because dry_run: true**
- Freqtrade simulates orders internally
- No need to call OpenAlgo's placeorder API
- This is the CORRECT behavior for dry-run mode

### Why Amount Shows 0?
**Dry-run simulation issue**
- In dry-run, Freqtrade doesn't calculate actual quantities
- It just tracks the stake amount
- In live mode, proper quantities are calculated

### Why No PnL Updates?
**Dry-run uses simulated fills**
- Prices are fetched from OpenAlgo
- But fills are simulated
- PnL calculation needs real fill data

---

## Recommendation

### For Now (Testing):
‚úÖ **Keep dry_run: true**
- Continue testing with AggressiveTestStrategy
- Verify all signals are generated correctly
- Check FreqUI displays properly
- No financial risk

### When Ready (Production):
‚ö†Ô∏è **Set dry_run: false**
- Create your own strategy (not random)
- Start with small stake amounts (1000-2000 INR)
- Limit max_open_trades to 1-2
- Monitor very closely for first few trades
- Set proper stop losses

---

## Summary

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ **Dry Run Mode** (SAFE)
- ‚úÖ Strategy working
- ‚úÖ Data fetching working
- ‚úÖ Symbol mapping working
- ‚úÖ FreqUI working
- ‚ùå No real orders (by design)

### To Place Real Orders:
1. Set `dry_run: false`
2. Restart Freqtrade
3. Monitor closely
4. Real orders will be placed on OpenAlgo

### Safety First:
- Start with dry-run
- Test thoroughly
- Use small amounts
- Monitor closely
- Have a stop plan
