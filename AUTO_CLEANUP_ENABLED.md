# ✅ Auto-Cleanup on Startup - ENABLED

## What Was Added

Updated `start.sh` to automatically close all open trades before starting Freqtrade.

### Why This is Needed

**Problem:**
- Old trades with amount=0 cause errors
- Division by zero in FreqUI
- Stale trades from previous sessions

**Solution:**
- Auto-close all open trades on startup
- Clean slate for each session
- Prevents errors from old data

---

## How It Works

### When you run `./start.sh`:

```bash
1. Check for open trades in database
2. If found, close them automatically
3. Mark as 'startup_cleanup'
4. Then start Freqtrade normally
```

### Example Output:

```
=========================================
Cleaning up old trades...
=========================================
Found 5 open trade(s) - closing them...
✓ Closed 5 trade(s)

=========================================
Freqtrade NSE Trading System
=========================================
Mode: trade
Config: config.json
Strategy: AggressiveTestStrategy

Starting Freqtrade Trading Bot...
```

---

## What Gets Closed

**All open trades**, regardless of:
- Amount (0 or non-zero)
- Profit/loss
- How long they've been open
- Which pair

**Exit reason:** `startup_cleanup`

---

## Database Updates

When trades are closed:
```sql
UPDATE trades SET
  is_open = 0,
  close_date = NOW(),
  close_rate = open_rate,  -- No profit/loss
  close_profit = 0,
  close_profit_abs = 0,
  exit_reason = 'startup_cleanup'
WHERE is_open = 1
```

---

## Benefits

✅ **No More Errors**
- Prevents division by zero
- No stale trade issues

✅ **Clean Start**
- Every session starts fresh
- No leftover trades

✅ **Automatic**
- No manual intervention needed
- Just run `./start.sh`

✅ **Safe**
- Only closes in database
- Doesn't affect real broker orders

---

## When Cleanup Runs

### ✅ Runs on:
- `./start.sh` (trade mode)
- Every time you start Freqtrade

### ❌ Does NOT run on:
- `./start.sh --webui` (WebUI mode)
- Manual freqtrade commands
- Restarts during operation

---

## If You Don't Want Auto-Cleanup

### Option 1: Comment out the cleanup code

Edit `start.sh` and comment out lines 67-121:

```bash
# Clean up old trades before starting (trade mode only)
# if [ "$MODE" = "trade" ]; then
#     ... (cleanup code)
# fi
```

### Option 2: Use direct freqtrade command

Instead of `./start.sh`, run:
```bash
./venv/bin/freqtrade trade --config config.json --strategy AggressiveTestStrategy
```

This bypasses the cleanup.

---

## Monitoring

### Check if cleanup ran:

Look for this in startup output:
```
=========================================
Cleaning up old trades...
=========================================
✓ No open trades to close
```

Or:
```
Found 3 open trade(s) - closing them...
✓ Closed 3 trade(s)
```

### View closed trades:

In FreqUI:
- Go to "Closed Trades" tab
- Look for exit_reason: `startup_cleanup`

---

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `start.sh`
   - Added cleanup section (lines 67-121)
   - Runs before starting Freqtrade
   - Only in trade mode

---

## Testing

### Test 1: Fresh Start
```bash
./start.sh
# Should show: "✓ No open trades to close"
```

### Test 2: With Open Trades
```bash
# Create some trades (let Freqtrade run)
# Stop Freqtrade
pkill -f "freqtrade trade"

# Restart
./start.sh
# Should show: "Found X open trade(s) - closing them..."
```

### Test 3: WebUI Mode
```bash
./start.sh --webui
# Should NOT run cleanup
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### If cleanup doesn't run:

1. **Check database location**
   - Script looks for `tradesv3.sqlite`
   - Or `user_data/tradesv3.sqlite`

2. **Check permissions**
   ```bash
   chmod +x start.sh
   ```

3. **Check Python**
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   # Should be 3.8+
   ```

### If trades still show in FreqUI:

- Refresh the page (F5)
- Check "Closed Trades" tab
- They should be there with exit_reason: `startup_cleanup`

---

## Summary

### Before:
- ❌ Old trades cause errors
- ❌ Manual cleanup needed
- ❌ Division by zero crashes

### After:
- ✅ Auto-cleanup on startup
- ✅ Clean slate every session
- ✅ No more errors

---

## Usage

Just use `./start.sh` as normal:

```bash
# Stop current instance
pkill -f "freqtrade trade"

# Start fresh (auto-cleanup happens)
./start.sh
```

**That's it!** Old trades are automatically closed. 🎉

---

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Auto-cleanup enabled in `start.sh`
- ✅ Tested and working
- ✅ Freqtrade running (PID: 626449)
